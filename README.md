> LoRAStencil: Low-Rank Adaptation of Stencil Computation on Tensor Cores

## Abstract

This artifact contains the source code of [LoRAStencil](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/SC41406.2024.00059), a novel stencil computing system designed to mitigate memory access redundancies on TCUs through low-rank adaptation.

## Prerequisites

- Hardware
  - x86-64 CPU
  - NVIDIA A100 GPU
- Software
  - CUDA - 12.2 (Tested). Lower versions down to CUDA 11.0 are also supported, but it may affect the performance.
  - GCC - above 9.4.0. You may also try to use icx or clang.

## Getting Code

The code can be downloaded using git:
```
git clone https://github.com/zondie17/LoRAStencil.git
```

## Compile

Use the following commands:
```
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make all -j24
```

## Usage

You can run `lorastencil` in the following input format.

```
lorastencil_{x}d shape input_size time_size
```
- `lorastencil_{x}d` can be chosen from `lorastencil_1d`, `lorastencil_2d`, and `lorastencil_3d` for different dimensions.
- `shape` can be chosen by the different dimension:
  - `1d1r` and `1d2r` for 1D
  - `star2d1r`, `box2d1r`, `star2d3r` and `box2d3r` for 2D
  - `star3d1r` and `box3d1r` for 3D
- `input_size` depends on the number of dimensions, with the number of inputs equals the value of `x` in `lorastencil_{x}d`.
- `time_size` is the iteration time number.
